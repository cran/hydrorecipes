Description: Additional steps to be used with the 'recipes' package. New steps
  were designed for regression deconvolution on datasets with millions of rows 
  with applications to signal decomposition and response 
  characterization. The methods in this package were developed as part of 
  PhD thesis titled High Frequency Water Level Responses to Natural 
  Signals <http://hdl.handle.net/10214/17890> by Jonathan Kennel in 2020.
